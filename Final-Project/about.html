            Hey my name is Leslie! I was born in Bolivia and immigrated here at 6 years old, currently a junior at Thomas Jefferson for sci and tech. I enjoy many things like
            playing basketball, baking, crafts/painting, and love binge watching
            movies.
            As a little girl I have always loved math and has been my favorite subject for a long time. Along with math in the complete opposite realm, Ive
loved design and art since a child aswell. Always competing in art
competitions in grade school it was a way to speak when I couldn't
speak english. Im involved in many things at school like being leader of the architecture and urban planning club, aswell as (ICE) innovations of engineering club. Outside of school I am part of a traditional bolivian dance group where we present in many places spreading the bolivian culture. And tutor kids on the side.
<br/><br/>
At school we are required to take a foundations to CS class and this really sparked my interest. I loved the pattern and the way all coders are still learning in this day and age. Along with last years code chica I was
introduced to html and building websites, it was kind of like art which even more interested me.
<br/><br/>
            My future goals are to go to college and major in civil engineering.
I hope to achieve higher learning in a university and pursue a career in civil engineer. My plan is to go to a close state school george Mason
university for a year because of financial needs and transfer to virginia tech second year as they have an awesome engineering program.

            Hi my name is Aolani Garza! I am a 10th grader at Thelma Salinas Early College. My hobbies are FFA and Cheerleading. My favorite subject is math because there is always a solution to every problem. How I help out my community is every Christmas my family and I give gifts to the needy. What sparked my interest in coding was my Tia. She was on social media and found out about Code Chica. She told me immediately and that's where it all began. One of my projects in coding is making a tic-tac-toe game.<br/><br/> My goal is to go to Michigan State University after high school and become a neonatologist. One of my all-time favorite movies is 50 First Dates. My contact information is my email <a href="mailto:Aolanirheegg@gmail.com">Aolanirheegg@gmail.com</a>. I am thankful to be able to be a part of Code Chica for allowing me to be with the best instructor and classmates. This program has taught me a lot and sparked my love for coding.

            My name is Olivia, I am 15 years old and love all things STEM. In 2022 I was in the 17th Code Chica Cohort and was very excited to learn that there was a new curriculum for Code Chica++. <br/><br/> I am currently taking engineering classes at my school and am also on the swim team. In my free time I love to draw, read, play video games and lift weights.
