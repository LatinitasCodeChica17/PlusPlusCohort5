            Hi my name is Aolani Garza! I am a 10th grader at Thelma Salinas Early College. My hobbies are FFA and Cheerleading. My favorite subject is math because there is always a solution to every problem. How I help out my community is every Christmas my family and I give gifts to the needy. What sparked my interest in coding was my Tia. She was on social media and found out about Code Chica. She told me immediately and that's where it all began. One of my projects in coding is making a tic-tac-toe game. My goal is to go to Michigan State University after high school and become a neonatologist. One of my all-time favorite movies is 50 First Dates. My contact information is my email <a href="mailto:Aolanirheegg@gmail.com">Aolanirheegg@gmail.com</a>. I am thankful to be able to be a part of Code Chica for allowing me to be with the best instructor and classmates. This program has taught me a lot and sparked my love for coding.

            My name is Olivia, I am 15 years old and love all things STEM. In 2022 I was in the 17th Code Chica Cohort and was very excited to learn that there was a new curriculum for Code Chica++. I am currently taking engineering classes at my school and am also on the swim team. In my free time I love to draw, read, play video games and lift weights.
